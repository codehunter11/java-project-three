Java Project 3 / DoodleSpace
==================

DoodleSpace Game. This game is a modified version of the original game called VoidSpace (an Asteroids like game), developed by Rene Badia. As part of the final project for the class of advanced programming, Rene Badia granted us permission to use his game and make our own version of the game. This version is a version based on doodles, you will have to fight against doodle enemy ships, asteroids, and also you will have to defeat the evil doodlstronaut.

The game was made in collaboration with another student, Amilcar Torres, who was my partner in this project.
